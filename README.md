# Cipher-JS

## Implemented Ciphers:
 * Fiestel Cipher

### Fielster Cipher:
 * fiestel.js has all the functions for the same.
 * To import it just copy it into your project folder and use:
 ` require(<path_fiestel.js>) ` \
 Or if it is present in the same directory
 ` let fiestel = require('./fiestel.js') `
